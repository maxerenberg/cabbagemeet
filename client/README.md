# CabbageMeet client

This directory contains the frontend source code for the CabbageMeet application.
It was created with [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev).

## Domains
* Set the environment variable REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL to the domain of the
  API server if it is different from the domain of the public website. This
  is useful if the static assets are being served from a CDN. Make sure to
  also set ENABLE_CORS=true in the server.
* Consider changing the `og:url` meta tag in index.html.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## E2E tests (Playwright)
### Dependencies
If you are going to use your computer's existing Chromium installation, you
don't need to install a Playwright-bundled browser (this needs to be the
latest Chromium version, though).

Otherwise, you need to install the Playwright browser(s) separately:
```bash
# Or chromium, webkit, etc.
# Omit the browser argument to install all browsers listed in playwright.config.ts
# Run `npx playwright install --help` to see all options
sudo npx playwright install --with-deps firefox

# Or, to just download the browser without the system dependencies
npx playwright install firefox
```

See https://playwright.dev/docs/cli#install-system-dependencies for details.

### Running the servers
#### Frontend
You can either start the Create-React-App server separately, or build the
static files and serve those from NestJS.

Option 1: start the Create-React-App server
```bash
# The NestJS server will listen on this port
export PROXY_PORT=3002
# The Create-React-App server will listen on this port
export PORT=3003
npm start
```

Option 2: use a static React build
```bash
npm run build
cd ../server
ln -sf ../client/build client
```

#### Backend
```bash
cd ../server
npm run build
# You can also place these env variables in a .env file
export DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
export SQLITE_PATH=:memory:
export PORT=3002
export VERIFY_SIGNUP_EMAIL_ADDRESS=false
export HOURLY_MEETING_CREATION_LIMIT_PER_IP=0
# Use http://127.0.0.1:3002 if using a static React build
export PUBLIC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3003
npm run start:prod
```

### Run tests locally
```bash
# Use http://127.0.0.1:3002 if using a static React build
export PUBLIC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3003
# I've noticed that the tests usually fail if run in headful mode
# in parallel, so best to only use one worker unless running headlessly
npm run test:e2e:cr -- --workers 1
```

### Run tests remotely with local browser
On the computer which will run the browser, run
```bash
# If unset, default is chromium
export BROWSER=firefox
# Set HEADLESS=true to run tests headlessly (default: false)
# Set PORT=<number> to run the websocket on a specific port (default: random)
tests/server.js
```

To use your system's existing chromium installation:
```bash
export BROWSER=chromium
export BROWSER_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium
tests/server.js
```

Make note of the port number which is printed on the command line, and
create an SSH reverse port forwarding, e.g.
```bash
# Replace 39671 with the actual port number
ssh -R 39671:localhost:39671 user@server
```

If you haven't done so already, make sure that you also forward port
3003 (if running the Create-React-App server, otherwise port 3002 if serving
the static build from NestJS) from your local machine to the server, via the
flag `-L 3003:localhost:3003`.

Now on the server, set the environment variable WS_ENDPOINT to the URL
which was printed earlier, then start the tests, e.g.
```bash
export WS_ENDPOINT=ws://127.0.0.1:39671/1234567890abcdef
# run test:e2e:ff for Firefox
npm run test:e2e:cr -- --workers 1
```
